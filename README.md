# ObesityPY

## Synopsis
This repository acts as the code base for machine learning work associated with the [NYU Langone Comprehensive Program on Obesity](https://med.nyu.edu/research/obesity/comprehensive-program-obesity).

An unofficial repository of the code under development as the work progresses can be found [here](https://github.com/narges-rzv/ObesityPY).

## Details

- Information on the features of the data can be found in this [notebook](https://github.com/NYUMedML/ObesityPY/blob/master/src/Pediatric_Obesity_Prediction_Feature_Data.ipynb) or for quicker loading, try on [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/NYUMedML/ObesityPY/blob/master/src/Pediatric_Obesity_Prediction_Feature_Data.ipynb)
- Information on the final analysis can be found in this [notebook](https://github.com/NYUMedML/ObesityPY/blob/master/src/Pediatric_Obesity_Prediction_Regression_100_bootstraps.ipynb) or for quicker loading, try on [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/NYUMedML/ObesityPY/blob/master/src/Pediatric_Obesity_Prediction_Regression_100_bootstraps.ipynb)
